Our App is base on an Android Bluetooth control LED tutorial, and modify by our own to fit our design. We keep the bluetooch connection part, but we dont need to control any LED, so we write our own button and screen in order to communicate with our embedded system.


LED.zip is the project file of Android Studio. It contain all the stuffs of our app.  

If u just want to read about the code we write/change, open ledControl.java, DeviceList.java, AndroidManifest.
